/**
 * XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.


What is XML?
    XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
    XML is a markup language much like HTML
    XML was designed to store and transport data
    XML was designed to be self-descriptive
    XML is a W3C Recommendation




XML Does Not DO Anything
XML is just information wrapped in tags.


The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:
    XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
    HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
    XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are



  
    * XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
    The XML language has no predefined tags.
    These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
    HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
    With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.
  
  
    * XML is Extensible
   Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).



    * XML Simplifies Things
    XML simplifies data sharing
    XML simplifies data transport
    XML simplifies platform changes
    XML simplifies data availability

    XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.
    XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.
    With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
